My name is Jasen Zhang (he/him/his), and I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the biostatistics department at [UCLA](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics). I am advised by [Dr. Andrew Holbrook](https://andrewjholbrook.github.io/), and my research interests include bayesian computation, stochastic processes and their intersection with artificial intelligence (AI).

Here, you can find information about my research, teaching resources, and get a sneak peak into my personal interests.
